What are we trying to do?

Predict future given a select source of information. From a research
perspective.

If P(A) is what we find from building a net given select sources,
and P(B|A) is all the future possibilities, then P(A|B) is the future predicted.


P(A|B) = P(B|A) Â· P(A)
	 -------------
		 P(B)



How is it done today? What are the limits of current practice?
 
Fragmented information sprawling different sources: social media, articles,
conversations, lectures, talks. Not centralized.


What is our approach? Why do we think it'll be successful?

Selectively choose high quality sources of information, and compress to
quantitative metrics. Build a relational network using those metrics. I don't
think it'll be very successful - that requires a history of astronomical data.


Checks for success?

Predicted is close 'enough' to reality, in short-term.
